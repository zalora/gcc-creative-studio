## System Architecture
![](./screenshots/creative-studio-architecture.png)

The backend follows a **Modular, Feature-Driven Architecture**, heavily inspired by the principles of Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters).

* **Structure:** Code is organized by feature domain (e.g., /images, /galleries, /users) rather than by technical layer (/controllers, /services).  
* **Rationale:**  
  * **Scalability:** This approach prevents individual directories from becoming unwieldy as the application grows.  
  * **Maintainability:** All code related to a single feature is co-located, making it easier to understand, modify, and test.  
  * **High Cohesion, Low Coupling:** Modules are self-contained and interact through well-defined interfaces (services and DTOs), making the system robust and flexible.

### Technology Stack

| Category | Technology / Service |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Frontend** | Angular, TypeScript, Angular Material, Tailwind CSS |
| **Backend** | Python, FastAPI, Pydantic |
| **Database** | Google Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL) |
| **Cloud Provider** | Google Cloud Platform (GCP) |
| **Deployment** | Cloud Run (for backend), Firebase Hosting (for frontend) |
| **AI Models** | Imagen, Veo, Gemini (via Vertex AI SDK) |


### Dependencies

Regarding the dependencies of the APIs and Services we’ll use (the Google APIs `‘xxxx.googleapis.com’` will be enabled by the script automatically):

* `Github Account` (You must have a Github Account to fork the repository)  
* `Google Cloud Account` (A GCP Project)
---
* `aiplatform.googleapis.com` (Vertex AI)  
* `artifactregistry.googleapis.com` (Artifact Registry)  
* `cloudbuild.googleapis.com` (Cloud Build)  
* `cloudfunctions.googleapis.com` (Cloud Functions)  
* `compute.googleapis.com` (Compute Engine)  
* `firebase.googleapis.com` (Firebase)  
* `sqladmin.googleapis.com` (Cloud SQL)  
* `iamcredentials.googleapis.com` (IAM Service API)  
* `iap.googleapis.com` (Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy)  
* `identitytoolkit.googleapis.com` (Identity Platform)  
* `run.googleapis.com` (Cloud Run)  
* `secretmanager.googleapis.com` (Secret Manager)  
* `texttospeech.googleapis.com` (Text to Speech)

For the deployment you can use CloudShell which already has all of the necessary, but in case of deploying from a computer, the script will automatically check for the following command-line tools and attempt to install them if they are missing or outdated.

* `gcloud` (Google Cloud SDK)  
* `git`  
* `jq` (JSON processor)  
* `firebase-tools` (Firebase CLI)  
* `uv` (Python package installer)  
* `terraform` (version 1.13.0 or newer) 


## Code Styling & Commit Guidelines

To maintain code quality and consistency:

* **TypeScript (Frontend):** We follow [Angular Coding Style Guide](https://angular.dev/style-guide) by leveraging the use of [Google's TypeScript Style Guide](https://github.com/google/gts) using `gts`. This includes a formatter, linter, and automatic code fixer.
* **Python (Backend):** We adhere to the [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html), using tools like `pylint` and `black` for linting and formatting.
* **Commit Messages:** We suggest following [Angular's Commit Message Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/commit-message-guidelines.md) to create clear and descriptive commit messages.

### Frontend (TypeScript with `gts`)

(Assumes setup within the `frontend/` directory)

1.  **Initialize `gts` (if not already done in the project):**
    Navigate to `frontend/` and run:
    ```bash
    npx gts init
    ```
    This will set up `gts` and create necessary configuration files (like `tsconfig.json`). Ensure your `tsconfig.json` (or a related `gts` config file like `.gtsrc`) includes an extension for `gts` defaults, typically:
    ```json
    {
      "extends": "./node_modules/gts/tsconfig-google.json"
      // ... other configurations
    }
    ```
2.  **Check for linting issues:**
    (This assumes a `lint` script is defined in `frontend/package.json`, e.g., `"lint": "gts lint"`)
    ```bash
    # from frontend/ directory
    npm run lint
    ```
3.  **Fix linting issues automatically (where possible):**
    (This assumes a `fix` script is defined in `frontend/package.json`, e.g., `"fix": "gts fix"`)
    ```bash
    # from frontend/ directory
    npm run fix
    ```

### Backend (Python with `pylint` and `black`)

(Assumes setup within the `backend/` directory and its virtual environment activated)

1.  **Ensure Dependencies are Installed:**
    Add `pylint` and `black` to your `backend/requirements.txt` file if not already present:
    ```
    pylint
    black
    ```
    Then install them within your virtual environment:
    ```bash
    # from backend/ directory, with .venv activated
    pip install pylint black
    # or pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  **Configure `pylint`:**
    It's recommended to have a `.pylintrc` file in your `backend/` directory to configure `pylint` rules. You can generate one if it doesn't exist:
    ```bash
    # from backend/ directory
    pylint --generate-rcfile > .pylintrc
    ```
    Customize this file according to your project's needs and the Google Python Style Guide.
3.  **Check for linting issues with `pylint`:**
    Navigate to the `backend/` directory and run:
    ```bash
    # from backend/ directory
    pylint .
    # Or specify modules/packages: pylint your_module_name
    ```
4.  **Format code with `black`:**
    To automatically format all Python files in the `backend/` directory and its subdirectories:
    ```bash
    # from backend/ directory
    python -m black . --line-length=80
    ```

# Step by step guide | Deploying and working on Creative Studio

This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough for setting up and running the Creative Studio application **on your local machine**. It covers the **standard local development setup using Docker Compose**.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:

*   **Git**: For cloning the repository.
*   **Google Cloud CLI (gcloud)**: For authenticating and managing your GCP resources.
*   **Github Account**: If you don't already have a GitHub account.
*   **Install Antigravity**: [Download Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/)
*   **Install Docker and docker compose**: [Download Docker](http://docker.com/get-started/)
*   **Install nvm**: [Download nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) and then install the latest node version. Version 20 or higher.
*   **Install uv**: A fast Python package installer. [Install it here](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).

## 2. Initial Setup

1.  Go to your GCP Account and make sure you can login.
2.  After you create your account:
    *   You create a fork of [Open Source Repo](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcc-creative-studio/tree/main)
    *   You see this video [How to Deploy Creative Studio.mp4](./screenshots/how_to_deploy_creative_studio.mp4) and deploy Creative Studio into your GCP Account environment, using CloudShell for simplicity.

## 3. Add env variables to repo where we’ll work

You can connect to your new GCP Argolis Account by setting a `backend/.env` file for the backend and a `frontend/src/environments/development.environment.ts` file for the frontend.

> **Important!!!** set `isLocal = True`, in both frontend and backend, this is so that instead of loggin in with Identity Platform, we login with Firebase, and we keep Identity Platform Authorized Javascript origins clean, without the need to whitelist localhost.

Add the following env variables in your cloned repo “gcc-creative-studio” modifying the corresponding locations, and replacing with your env values:

### `backend/.env` file

```bash
# Common env vars
FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:4200"
ENVIRONMENT="local"
LOG_LEVEL="INFO"

# Project ID: creative-studio-deploy
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="creative-studio-deploy"
PROJECT_ID="creative-studio-deploy"
GENMEDIA_BUCKET="creative-studio-deploy-cs-development-bucket"
SIGNING_SA_EMAIL="cs-development-read@creative-studio-deploy.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
GOOGLE_TOKEN_AUDIENCE="XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXX.apps.googleusercontent.com"
IDENTITY_PLATFORM_ALLOWED_ORGS=""

# --- Database Configuration (Local Docker Postgres) ---
DB_USER="studio_user"
DB_PASS="studio_pass"
DB_NAME="creative_studio"
DB_HOST="postgres"
DB_PORT="5432"
USE_CLOUD_SQL_AUTH_PROXY=false
ADMIN_USER_EMAIL="your-user-email"
```

> 💡 **Best Practice Tip: Local PostgreSQL Container**
> For local development and testing, we include a lightweight PostgreSQL Docker container to bypass the need for an actual Cloud SQL instance. This delivers key advantages:
> - **Zero Costs**: Avoids billing accrual on cloud data lookups during validation work cycles.
> - **Safe Experimentation**: Clear volume bindings locally without risking production states or accidental cloud data drops.
> - **Instant Migrations Validation**: Speed runs Alembic updates completely isolated and offline.

### `frontend/src/environments/development.environment.ts` file

```typescript
export const environment = {
  // Project ID: creative-studio-deploy
  firebase: {
    apiKey: "your-api-key",
    authDomain: "creative-studio-deploy.firebaseapp.com",
    projectId: "creative-studio-deploy",
    storageBucket: "creative-studio-deploy.firebasestorage.app",
    messagingSenderId: "your-messaging-sender-id",
    appId: "your-app-id",
    measurementId: "G-XXXXXXXX"
  },
  production: false,
  isLocal: true,
  GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID: 'XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXX.apps.googleusercontent.com',
  backendURL: 'http://localhost:8080/api',

  // Common env vars
  EMAIL_REGEX: /^(([^<>()[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+(\.[^<>()[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+)*)|(".+"))@((\[\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\])|(([a-zA-Z\-0-9]+\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}))$/,
  ADMIN: 'admin',
};
```

## 4. Running with Docker Compose

We use Docker to build and run both the frontend and backend containers, simplifying the setup process.

After installation and before running docker compose, be sure to set your default gcloud login:

```bash
# Set the target project for the deployment
gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID

# Set up application-default credentials
gcloud auth application-default login
```

And also to give your account access to presign the urls you’ll get on your frontend:

```bash
export PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get project)
export USER_EMAIL=$(gcloud config get account)

gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding cs-development-read@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com --member="user:$USER_EMAIL" --role="roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator"
```

You are all set, from the root of the project, run the following command:

```bash
docker compose up
```

### 💡 Seeding Initial Workspaces (Local Development/Testing)
If you are running this locally for the first time or your database is fresh, you might find that the Workspaces list is empty. You should run the bootstrap script once to seed default templates and verify access:

```bash
docker exec -t creative-studio-backend sh -c "PYTHONPATH=/app uv run python -m bootstrap.bootstrap"
```

As this uses volumes, and we use hot reload to start the services, every time you change something on the files the container will be refreshed with the changes.
